# Genome-Data-Compression

With the Recent development of DNA sequencing
technologies, Genome data compression plays an important tole
to due to the huge volume of genomic data. . Such a big amount of
genome data needs appropriate data storage, data management,
and data transfer policies. Compressing genomes can be used
for efficient data storage, data management and data transfer
policies. Autoencoder is a kind of deep neural network. It can
be used to compress data.

We aim to perform compression on a
DNA corpus using the Autoencoder and optimize it such that
the compression ratio and computational time is acceptable
or better than existing methods like GeCO2, GeCO3.

->Attached are the two Colab notebooks used, one for training the model and the other 
used to test the model against a DNA sample.
->The dataset has also been split accordingly in the 'Dataset' folder.
->Both the huffman encoded files are available along with the reconstructed file for the 
example DNA sample in their respective folders.
